## Intro
I want to keep this post short, but I also wanted there to be some content found on the blog page as we start to advertise this project. 

## What We are working on
What we are working on:
1. Building the website out you are currently on.
2. Designing the facility and advertisement content.
3. Designing, and building out our technology stack.
