## :white_check_mark: Goals
1. :construction: **Build a data center:**
  (This could be something as simple as a steel structure kit building, with all the appropriate infrastructure).
2. :two_men_holding_hands: **Be controlled by the community:**
  We want our data center to feel like it's yours. The idea here is a "customer-operated" business model, meaning that, before we do upgrades, or where the money is spent, current customers get to vote on where that money is spent.
3. :office: **Transparency:**
   I think historically, we have all seen business practices that drive us crazy. When a company starting with B and ending in comm bought another company that started with VM and ended in wear, customers saw their costs go up as much as 600%. We want to prevent that from happening to you.
4. :dollar: **Cost-Capped (cost share):**
   We do not have an exact number set, but the idea here is to cost-share the facility. As customers come into a facility, we split the cost between customers, then (+25%) or so on top of that for management and overhead costs. This means you will never feel like you are getting the short end of the stick, like a contract renewal with a 600% increase.
